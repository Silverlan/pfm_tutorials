pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_intro = "Welcome to the lighting tutorial series. This series will teach you the basics on the lighting systems in Pragma, the different types of light sources, etc.\nPFM uses a combination of dynamic and static lighting (aka baked lighting). Dynamic light sources can be animated, and they can cast dynamic shadows, however they do not create any indirect lighting and overall produce less realistic results compared to static light sources.\nStatic light sources on the other hand cannot be animated or cast dynamic shadows, but produce more realistic lighting at the cost of lengthy bake times."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_soft_shadows = "This example scene currently only contains static lighting, which has already been baked. If you move around the scene in the viewport, you can see soft shadows around objects and wall corners, which can only be achieved using static lighting. Note how the character standing in the room has no shadow and appears evenly lit. This is because static lighting only affects static, immovable objects in the scene, dynamic actors are mostly unaffected by it. For this reason static lighting is generally only used for background objects, i.e. the stage or scenebuild of your animation.\n\nSince the static lighting has already been baked in this scene, it can no longer be changed without re-baking, which you will learn how to do in the next tutorial. For the purposes of this tutorial we will focus on dynamic lighting first."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_light_types = "Dynamic lighting can affect both static and dynamic actors. There are three types of dynamic light sources available in PFM: Spot lights, which emit light in a cone-shape in a particular direction (like a flashlight), point lights, which emit light in all directions equally, and directional light sources, which can be used to simulate sunlight."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_spot_light = "Let's start by creating a simple spot light source. To do so, click this button and choose \"{pfm_create_new_spot_light}\" from the list."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_components = "By default new light sources are automatically placed in the \"lighting\" collection in the actor editor.\nEvery light source has several components that allow you to change its properties, such as the \"{c_color}\", \"{c_radius}\", \"{c_light}\" and \"{c_light_spot}\" components here. Let's start with the \"{c_light}\" component."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_intensity_type = "The \"{c_light_p_intensity}\" property of the \"{c_light}\" component allows you to change the brightness of the light source. By default the unit for the intensity value is measured in \"{candela}\", but you can also change it to \"{lumen}\" using the \"{c_light_p_intensity_type}\" property.\nIf the intensity type is set to Candela, the perceived light intensity will be the same regardless of the light's cone angle.\nOn the other hand, if the intensity type is set to Lumen, increasing the light's cone angle will decrease the perceived intensity."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_shadows = "By default, dynamic light sources do not cast shadows. This is because shadows require a large amount of VRAM and are expensive to render, so you should use them sparingly. Although there is no hard limit, shadow casting light sources should generally be limited to two or three per scene at most.\nTry enabling shadow casting for this light source."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_baked = "The \"{c_light_p_baked}\" toggle determines whether a light source is dynamic or static. Light sources are dynamic by default, so we can ignore this property for now, but we'll come back to it in the tutorial for static lighting."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_blend_fraction = "The \"{c_light_spot_p_blend_fraction}\" property can be used to create soft or hard edges, with 0 being the hardest and 1 the softest.\n\nTry changing the value to see how it affects the light source."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_camera_link = "Sometimes placing a spot light source in just the right way can be tricky using the viewport manipulator controls, in which case you can try using the \"Camera Link\" mode to place the light source instead. To enter this mode, right-click the light source in the actor editor and select \"{pfm_toggle_camera_link}\"."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_camera_link_placement = "While in this mode, the light source is temporarily linked to the work camera, allowing you to place it by moving the camera. You can also use the mouse wheel to change the cone angle of the light source. To end the mode, and place the light source at the current location, simply left-click into the viewport."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_cycles = "The distinction between static and dynamic lighting only matters if you're using the Pragma renderer. When rendering with Cycles X, both types are treated exactly the same.\n\nSince Cycles is a different type of renderer compared to Pragma, the lighting will inevitably look a little different. If you're planning on using the Cycles renderer, and you want to make changes to the lighting in the scene, you will have to enable the \"{pfm_viewport_rt_enabled}\" mode in order to preview the changes. This mode was already introducted in the \"{pfm_tutorial_viewport}\" tutorial, but let's take a quick refresher.\n\nPress the \"{pfm_viewport_rt_enabled}\" button to enable the preview mode."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_cycles_editing = "Scene editing while in this mode is limited, but changes to light sources will be apparent immediately. Try changing the color, intensity or cone angle of the light source to see the changes in the viewport. Please note that some properties, like the radius, do not have any effect when rendering with Cycles X."

pfm_tut_dynamic_lighting_conclusion = "This concludes the tutorial on dynamic lighting.\n\nYou can now end the tutorial, or press the continue-button to start the next tutorial in this series."
