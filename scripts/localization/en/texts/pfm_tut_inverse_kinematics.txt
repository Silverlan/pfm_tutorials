pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_intro = "Welcome to the tutorial on character posing. In this tutorial you will learn how to use inverse kinematics (IK) to pose and animate characters in PFM.\nWith IK, you can easily manipulate specific body parts, like hands or feet, without having to worry about the rest of the limb (like the elbow). This makes it significantly easier to create natural-looking movements."
pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_options = "There are two approaches you can take to utilize IK in PFM: Simple IK chains, or pre-made IK rig configurations.\nWhile IK rigs provide a broader range of possibilities, including full-body IK and IK limits, they can be tricky to set up. To begin with, we'll focus on the simpler IK chains to get you started."
pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_determine_bone = "First you have to determine which bones you wish to control using IK. This will typically be the extremeties, like hands or feet. In our case, we'll be setting up an IK chain for the left hand of our character, specifically the \"{0}\" bone.\n\nTo locate the \"{0}\" bone in the viewport, select the character by left-clicking it, then click the character's left hand. Alternatively, you can also locate the bone within the actor editor. Select the bone to continue."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_select_chain_length = "Next, right-click the bone in the actor editor and select \"{pfm_actor_editor_add_ik_control}\" from the context menu. Here you now have to choose the chain length for the IK chain, which determines how many bones upward in the bone hierarchy will be affected by this IK chain.\nFor this example, we want the chain to go up all the way to the shoulder bone, which means we want a chain length of {0}. It's worth noting that the shoulder bone itself will not be affected by the IK chain. However, all the bones in between (such as the upper arm and lower arm) as well as the end effector (the hand bone) will be influenced. Consequently, using forward kinematics for these bones will no longer be possible.\n\nSelect the chain length of {0} to continue."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_controls = "In the actor editor you can now find a new component called "{c_ik_solver}". If you expand this component you will see two controls, one for the effector (the hand) and one for the lower arm. If you select one of these controls, you can move them around using the transform tools in the viewport.\n\nTry moving the hand to the spot in the viewport indicated by the target symbol using the \"Move\" tool."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_elbow_orientation = "Note how, contrary to forward kinematics, the rotation of the hand does not change with its parent bone. You can use the rotation tool to put it in your desired orientation.\nAlso, directly altering the orientation of the lower or upper arm bones is not possible, however you can indirectly affect their orientation by moving the lower arm control."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_multi_ik_chain = "You can also define multiple IK chains for the same actor, such as one for each arm and each leg. The IK chains must not share any bones between them, however.\n\nYou can try it now by adding a second IK chain, for instance for the right foot with a chain length of {}, or you can click "{pfm_continue}" to move on to the next portion of this tutorial."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_ik_rig = "As mentioned at the beginning of the tutorial, in addition to simple IK chains, there are also IK rigs, which are significantly more powerful.\n\nCreating a custom IK rig is a little more involved, so it will be covered in a separate tutorial. For now we'll just take a quick look at how to use an existing IK rig."
