pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_intro = "Welcome to the tutorial on character posing. In this tutorial you will learn how to use inverse kinematics (IK) to pose and animate characters in PFM.\nUsing IK, you can directly position a character's hands, feet, or other body parts, and have the rest of their limbs and body follow naturally. This makes it significantly easier to create natural-looking poses or movements."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_options = "There are two main approaches for utilizing IK in PFM: \"Quick IK\", or using an \"IK rig\".\nUsing IK rigs enables you to use advanced features such as full-body IK and IK limits, which help to avoid unnatural poses. However, they can be tricky to set up, so we will cover them in a later tutorial.\n\nFor now, let's concentrate on the Quick IK system to help you get started."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_determine_bone = "The \"Quick IK\" system can be used to quickly set up a simple IK chain for a specific body part. For this demonstration, we want to be able to pose the left hand of our character using inverse kinematics.\n\nSelect the \"{0}\" bone by selecting the character in the viewport, and then clicking the character's left hand. Alternatively, you can locate the bone within the actor editor and select it from there."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_select_chain_length = "Next, right-click the bone in the actor editor to open the context menu, then select the option labeled \"{pfm_actor_editor_add_ik_control}\". Here you now have to specify the \"chain length\" for the IK chain. The chain length determines the number of parent bones that will be affected when positioning the bone.\n\nIn this example, positioning the hand should also affect both the lower and upper arm. We also need to include the shoulder bone, which will act as a pivot point. All in all this means we need a chain length of {0}.\nPlease note that once a bone becomes part of an IK chain or IK rig, you will no longer be able to use forward kinematics to control that particular bone directly.\n\nSelect the chain length of {0} to continue."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_controls = "In the actor editor you can now find a new component called "{c_ik_solver}". If you expand this component you will see two controls, one for the hand (also called the \"effector\") and one for its immediate parent, the lower arm. To move the hand to a specific position, you can select the hand control and use the manipulator controls in the viewport. Alternatively you can also click the hand or lower arm bone in the viewport if you're in \"{pfm_viewport_tool_select}\" mode, which will now also select the IK control instead of the original bone.\n\nTry moving the hand control to the indicated target position using the \"{pfm_viewport_tool_move}\" manipulator."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_controls2 = "As you can see, moving the hand now causes the entire arm to move accordingly. You can also rotate the hand using the \"{pfm_viewport_tool_rotate}\" manipulator, however doing so will not affect the rest of the IK chain.\nThe lower arm control allows you to adjust the orientation of the arm, while keeping the hand largely in place. Manually rotating any of the bones in the IK chain other than the hand bone is not possible.\n\nYou can define as many IK chains for the same actor as you want, such as one for each arm and each leg, but the IK chains must not share any bones between them."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_ik_rig = "As mentioned at the beginning of the tutorial, in addition to the quick IK system, there are also IK rigs, which are significantly more powerful.\n\nCreating a custom IK rig is a little more involved, so it will be covered in a separate tutorial. For now we'll just take a quick look at how to use an existing IK rig."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_ik_rig_property = "An IK rig is only compatible with the model that was used to create it, or other models that have the same bone names and hierarchy. They are stored in configuration files with the \"pikr\" extension.\n\nTo apply an IK rig, you have to go back to the \"{c_ik_solver}\" component in the actor editor, then select the \"{c_ik_solver_p_rig_config_file}\" property."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_ik_rig_file = "Here you now have to specify the path to an IK rig. You can click this button to browse all available IK rigs, then double click a rig to apply it.\n\nFor this tutorial, apply the IK rig \"{}\" to continue."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_ik_rig_hand_control = "Next, go back to the IK control properties. Now that the IK rig has been applied, our previous IK chain has been removed and replaced with new controls. If you try moving the new controls around, you may notice that the IK behavior has changed. The IK rig imposes angular limits to prevent some unnatural poses, such as the elbow bending backwards, and moving the hands now also affects the upper body instead of just the arms."

pfm_tut_inverse_kinematics_conclusion = "This concludes the tutorial on the IK basics.\n\nYou can now end the tutorial, or press the continue-button to start the next tutorial in this series."
