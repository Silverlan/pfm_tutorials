pfm_tut_static_lighting_intro = "Welcome to the static lighting tutorial. With static lighting you can achieve significantly more realistic results compared to dynamic lighting, however static lighting only works for static, non-moving actors and cannot be changed once it has been baked. For this reason static lighting is only recommended for scenebuilds or maps, which you can then use as stage for your animation and combine it with dynamic lighting.\n\nThis tutorial will teach you how to set up your scene for static lighting, and how to then bake the lighting into a lightmap atlas."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmap_atlas = "Before we can start the baking process, we will first have to place some light sources in the scene. The initial steps are very similar compared to dynamic lighting and you can use the same light source types.\n\nLet's start by placing a point light source in the scene."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_baked = "Next, enable the \"{c_light_p_baked}\" property of the light source, which will turn the dynamic light source into a static one. Note how upon enabling the property, the light source disappears from the viewport, but it will still influence the scene once we start baking the lightmaps.\n\nYou do not have to enable the \"{c_light_p_cast_shadows}\" property, as static light sources always cast shadows for static actors."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_live_rt = "In order to bake the lightmaps, we will have to use the {pfm_render_engine_cycles} renderer. Depending on your hardware, the scene complexity and the render settings, this can take a long time. To get a fast approximation of what the scene will look like with baked lightmaps, you can switch to the \"{pfm_viewport_rt_enabled}\" mode. Any changes you make to static light sources are only visible while you are in this mode, which is why it is recommended to leave this mode on until you have finished setting up all of the static light sources and are ready to bake the lightmaps.\n\nTurn on \"{pfm_viewport_rt_enabled}\" mode to continue. PFM may appear frozen for a moment when you do."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_live_rt_edit = "Now try changing some of the light's properties, such as the color or intensity, or try moving it around, to see how it changes in the viewport. Note that some properties, like the radius, do not have any effect on static light sources."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_sky = "If you have an outdoors scene, or an indoor scene connected to the outdoors (e.g. through windows), the static lighting can also be heavily influenced by the sky. To do so, you will have to add a sky actor to your scene.\n\nTry doing so now."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_refresh_rt_view = "While in RT mode, some actions, like adding a sky, cannot be updated right away. In such cases you have to press the \"{pfm_refresh_rt_view}\" button to see the changes.\n\nTry pressing it now to see how the lighting changes with the sky."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_sky_strength = "You can change the sky's \"{c_pfm_sky_p_strength}\" property to increase its influence on the lighting, however you will have to refresh the RT view every time you change it. In addition, changing the sky texture will also change the lighting.\n\nTry changing the sky strength to {} and refresh the RT view."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper = "Once you're satisfied with the lighting in the scene, you can start the baking process. To do so you first need to add a \"Lightmapper\" actor to your scene, which we will use to render the lightmaps.\n\nCreate the lightmapper to continue."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_select = "Next, select the \"{c_pfm_baked_lighting}\" component of the lightmapper in the actor editor. You can find it in the \"baking\" collection."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_resolution = "The lightmapper has a variety of render settings. Unless you have prior experience, it is generally recommended not to change any of the settings manually and use the quality presets instead. Higher preset quality options will significantly improve the quality of the lightmaps, at the cost of increased render times and disk space requirement for the lightmap textures. The recommended setting for baking the final lightmaps is \"{pfm_preset_production_4k}\", however rendering with this setting may take several hours or more. For now we will just use some low-quality settings as demonstration.\n\nChange the preset to \"{low}\" to continue."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_render = "Next, click on \"{pfm_bake_lightmaps}\" to start the render. Please note that PFM may appear frozen for a bit before rendering starts."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_render_progress = "Please wait for the render to complete. This may take a few minutes. Until the render is complete, the objects in the viewport may appear disorted."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_render_complete = "The baking is now complete and you can see the baked lighting in the viewport. Since we used very low-quality settings, the result doesn't look very pleasing and you may notice a lot of artifacts, but it should be enough to give you a reasonable idea of what the scene will look like when you use high-resolution settings."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_render_job = "As mentioned earlier, baking at higher quality settings can take a long time, which is why it is generally recommended to use a render job instead. As you may remember from the render panel tutorial, a render job allows you to render without having to keep PFM running. Once rendering is complete, you can then import the rendered lightmap textures into PFM.\n\nLet's try it out!"

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_render_job_create = "To create a lightmap render job, press the \"{pfm_generate_render_job}\" button. A new window will appear with a \"{}\". Execute this file by double-clicking it to start the render. In normal circumstances you would then close PFM and let the render continue in the background until it is complete, but for the purposes of this tutorial, we'll keep PFM running.\n\nWait for the render to complete, then press \"{pfm_continue}\"."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_render_job_import = "Once the lightmap textures have been rendered, you can press the \"{pfm_import_render_tool_lightmaps}\" button. This will automatically import the rendered lightmap textures and assign them to this scene."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_exposure = "Now that the static lighting has been baked, you cannot make any changes to it anymore, unless you re-bake the textures. You can, however, adjust the lightmap exposure level without having to re-bake, which gives you some small control over the brightness of the scene."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_reflection_probe = "In addition to baked lighting, you should always place at least one reflection probe in your scene. Reflection probes capture reflection information in the scene and help improve the rendering quality of reflective actors.\n\nTry creating a reflection probe now."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_reflection_probe_placement = "The reflection probe should be placed roughly near the center of your scene, in view of the scene camera. It should be roughly in eye height and there should be no other static actors or walls nearby obstructing it.\n\nMove the reflection probe to the indicated position in the scene to continue."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_reflection_probe_bake = "Once you have found a good position for your reflection probe, it still has to be baked. Fortunately this is much faster compared to baking lightmaps and should only take a few seconds.\n\nPress the \"{pfm_bake_reflection_probe}\" button to continue."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_reflection_probe_baking = "Now wait for the baking to complete."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_reflection_probe_view = "A new window has opened, which shows the rendered reflection data as a spherical view. You can click into the view and move the mouse to look around. The view should contain all of the static actors in the scene. Some parts may be blurry, but that is okay. If parts of the scene are obstructed, you may want to move the probe to a different position and bake it again.\n\nAs with the lightmaps, the reflection probe will also have to be re-baked if you make any changes to the lighting in the scene."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_conclusion = "This concludes the tutorial on lightmap baking. Lightmap baking harmonizes well with scenebuilds, which you can find a tutorial for under \"workflows/scenebuilds\".\n\nThere are still some lighting concepts that we haven't covered yet. We will get to those in the next lighting tutorial."
