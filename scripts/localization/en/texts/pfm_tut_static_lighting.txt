pfm_tut_static_lighting_intro = "Welcome to the static lighting tutorial. With static lighting you can achieve significantly more realistic results compared to dynamic lighting, however static lighting only works for static, non-moving actors and cannot be changed once it has been baked. For this reason static lighting is only recommended for scenebuilds, which you can then use as stage for your animation and combine it with dynamic lighting.\n\nThis tutorial will teach you how to set up static lighting for your scene and what to be mindful of."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmap_atlas = "Static lighting has to be baked, but before we can do so, we first have to place some light sources in the scene. The initial steps are very similar compared to dynamic lighting and you can use the same light source types.\n\nLet's start by placing a point light source in the scene."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_baked = "Next, enable the \"{c_light_p_baked}\" property of the light source, which will turn the dynamic light source into a static one. Note how upon enabling the property, the light source disappears from the viewport, but it will still influence the scene once we start baking the lightmaps.\n\nYou do not have to enable the \"{c_light_p_cast_shadows}\" property, as static light sources always cast shadows."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_live_rt = "In order to bake the lightmaps, we will have to use the {pfm_render_engine_cycles} renderer. Depending on your hardware, the scene complexity and other factors, baking can take a long time. To get a fast approximation of what the scene will look like with baked lightmaps, you can switch to the \"{pfm_viewport_rt_enabled}\" mode. Any changes you make to static light sources are only visible while you are in this mode, which is why it is recommended to leave this mode turned on until you have finished setting up all of the static light sources and are ready to bake the lightmaps.\n\nTurn on \"{pfm_viewport_rt_enabled}\" mode to continue. PFM may appear frozen for a moment when you do."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_live_rt_edit = "Now try changing some of the light's properties, such as the color or intensity, or try moving it around, to see how it changes in the viewport. Note that some properties, like the radius, do not have any effect on static light sources."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_sky = "If you have an outdoors scene, or an indoors scene connected to the outdoors (e.g. through windows), the static lighting can also be heavily influenced by adding a sky. To do so, you will have to add a sky actor to your scene.\n\nTry doing so now."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_refresh_rt_view = "In \"{pfm_viewport_rt_enabled}\" mode, some actions, like adding a sky, cannot be updated automatically. In such cases you have to press the \"{pfm_refresh_rt_view}\" button to see the changes.\n\nTry pressing it now to see how the lighting changes with the sky."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_sky_strength = "You can change the sky's \"{c_pfm_sky_p_strength}\" property to increase its influence on the lighting, however you will have to refresh the RT view whenever you change it. In addition, changing the sky texture or sky angle will also affect the lighting.\n\nTry changing the sky strength to {} and refresh the RT view."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper = "Once you're satisfied with the lighting in the scene, you can start the baking process. To do so you first need to add a \"Lightmapper\" actor to your scene, which we will use to render the lightmaps.\n\nCreate the lightmapper to continue."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_select = "Next, select the \"{c_pfm_baked_lighting}\" component of the lightmapper in the actor editor. You can find it in the \"baking\" collection."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_resolution = "The lightmapper has a variety of render settings, however it is generally recommended to use the quality presets instead. Higher preset quality options will significantly improve the quality of the lightmaps, at the cost of increased render times, as well as higher disk space and VRAM usage. The recommended setting for baking the final lightmaps is \"{pfm_preset_production_4k}\", however rendering with this setting may take several hours or more.\n\nFor this demonstration we will just use some low-quality settings, with which it should only take a few minutes to render. Change the preset to \"{low}\" to continue."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_render = "Next, click on \"{pfm_bake_lightmaps}\" to start the render. Please note that PFM may appear frozen for a bit before rendering starts."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_render_progress = "Please wait for the render to complete. This may take a few minutes. Until the render is complete, the objects in the viewport may appear distorted and PFM may react slowly to inputs."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_render_complete = "The baking is now complete. The window that has opened allows you to inspect the baked lightmaps for potential issues, but you can close it for now. In the viewport you can now view the scene with the baked lighting. Because of the low-quality settings we used, you may notice artifacts and blurry shadows. These will improve significantly when you render with higher quality settings."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_render_job = "Before we continue, you should know about an alternative method for baking lightmaps. As mentioned earlier, baking at higher quality settings can take a long time, which is why it is generally recommended to use a render job instead. As you may remember from the render panel tutorial, a render job allows you to render without having to keep PFM running.\n\nLet's give it a shot!"

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_render_job_create = "To create a lightmap render job, press the \"{pfm_generate_render_job}\" button. A new explorer window will appear with a file called \"{}\". You can execute this render job by double-clicking it to start the render. Normally you could then close PFM and let the render continue in the background until it is complete, but for the purposes of this tutorial, let's keep PFM running.\n\nWait for the render to complete, then press \"{pfm_continue}\"."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_render_job_import = "Once the lightmap textures have been rendered using the render job, you can press the \"{pfm_import_render_tool_lightmaps}\" button. This will automatically import the rendered lightmap textures and assign them to this scene.\n\nThis method produces the same results, but has the advantage that you do not have to keep PFM running during the render. Using this method will also decrease the render times."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_lightmapper_exposure = "Now that the static lighting has been baked, you cannot make any changes to it anymore without re-baking the lightmaps. You can still, however, adjust the lightmap exposure level, which gives you some small control over the overall brightness of the static lighting."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_reflection_probe = "You may have noticed that the character in the scene is completely unlit. This is because lightmaps can only be used with static actors, and the character in this scene is a dynamic actor. In order to make use of static lighting for dynamic actors, you need to add and bake a \"{c_reflection_probe}\" to the scene as well.\n\nTry creating a reflection probe now."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_reflection_probe_placement = "Reflection probes capture reflection information of the scene all around them. To be most effective, the reflection probe should be placed near the center of your scene, in view of the scene camera. It should be roughly in eye height and there should be no other static actors or walls nearby obstructing it.\n\nSwitch to the \"{pfm_viewport_tool_move}\" tool in the viewport, then move the reflection probe to the indicated position in the scene to continue."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_reflection_probe_bake = "Once you have found a good position for your reflection probe, it still has to be baked. Fortunately this is much faster compared to baking lightmaps and should only take a few seconds.\n\nSelect the \"{c_reflection_probe}\" component and press the \"{pfm_bake_reflection_probe}\" button to continue."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_reflection_probe_baking = "Please wait for the baking to complete."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_reflection_probe_view = "A new window has opened, which shows the rendered reflection data as a spherical view. You can click into the view and move the mouse to look around. The view should contain all of the static actors in the scene and some portions may appear blurry.\nIn general, if parts of the scene are obstructed, you need to move the probe to a different position and bake it again.\n\nAs with the lightmaps, the reflection probe will also have to be re-baked if you make any changes to the static lighting in the scene."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_reflection_probe_dynamic_actors = "You can now close the reflection probe view. If you take a look at the viewport, you'll notice that the character no longer appears black, which means it is now affected by the reflection probe. Please note that reflection probes only apply some indirect lighting to dynamic actors, you will still need to place dynamic light sources as well to make sure your dynamic actors are lit properly."

pfm_tut_static_lighting_conclusion = "This concludes the tutorial on static lighting.\n\nYou can now end the tutorial, or press the continue-button to start the next series."
